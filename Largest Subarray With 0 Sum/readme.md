### Given an array having both positive and negative integers. The task is to compute the length of the largest subarray with sum 0.

### Example 1:

**Input:**  
```
N = 8
A[] = {15, -2, 2, -8, 1, 7, 10, 23}
```

**Output:**  
```
5
```

**Explanation:**  
The largest subarray with sum 0 will be `-2 2 -8 1 7`.

### Your Task:
You just have to complete the function `maxLen()` which takes two arguments, an array `A` and `n`, where `n` is the size of the array `A` and returns the length of the largest subarray with 0 sum.

### Expected Time Complexity: 
```
O(N)
```

### Expected Auxiliary Space: 
```
O(N)
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= N <= 10^5`
- `-1000 <= A[i] <= 1000`, for each valid `i`
