Problem statement
For a given integer array/list 'ARR' of size 'N' containing all distinct values, find the total number of 'Inversions' that may exist.

An inversion is defined for a pair of integers in the array/list when the following two conditions are met.

A pair ('ARR[i]', 'ARR[j]') is said to be an inversion when:

1. 'ARR[i] > 'ARR[j]' 
2. 'i' < 'j'

Where 'i' and 'j' denote the indices ranging from [0, 'N').
